Next.js 15 brings exciting new features and improvements to the React framework. In this post, we'll explore the key changes and how to get started.

## What's New in Next.js 15

- **App Router**: The new App Router provides a more intuitive way to structure your applications
- **Server Components**: Better performance with server-side rendering
- **Turbopack**: Faster builds and development experience

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js 15 project:

\`\`\`bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
\`\`\`

This will start your development server on http://localhost:3000.

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 continues to push the boundaries of what's possible with React applications. The new features make it easier than ever to build fast, scalable web applications.`,

A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.

## Why Design Systems Matter

Design systems help teams:
- **Consistency**: Ensure visual and functional consistency across products
- **Efficiency**: Reduce design and development time
- **Scalability**: Make it easier to scale design across teams
- **Quality**: Improve overall product quality

## Key Components

A typical design system includes:

1. **Design Tokens**: Colors, typography, spacing values
2. **Components**: Reusable UI elements
3. **Patterns**: Common interaction patterns
4. **Guidelines**: Usage instructions and best practices

## Getting Started

Start small with your most commonly used components and gradually expand your system. Focus on consistency and clear documentation.`,
